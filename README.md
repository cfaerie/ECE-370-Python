# ECE 370 Python
This is a recreation of code from my ECE 370 Struct repository. 
This was done to better understand the differences between Python and C++. Also to refresh my Python syntax knowledge.

The program reads a list of contacts from a .txt file.
The contacts are put into a class, similar to the structure originally built in C++. 

The program will need to be able to:
-Print the contacts from the class
-Sort the contacts in the class by ID Number, Ascending
-Search the class for a contact with a certain last name. And print a list of found persons that were searched during the session.
